## Introduction

This repository contains a school project completed as part of my academic work at university.  
The project focuses on Malliavin calculus and Monte Carlo methods, combining mathematical theory and programming implementation in Python.  

Parts A and C were done by me.

It was developed for educational purposes and illustrates techniques in stochastic analysis and simulation.

Final grade received: 14.5 / 20
